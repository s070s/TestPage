            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein stands as one of history's most influential scientists, particularly renowned for developing the theory of relativity and making significant contributions to quantum mechanics. Born in Germany in 1879, he later moved to Switzerland, where he studied physics and worked at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. His groundbreaking year of 1905, known as his annus mirabilis, saw him publish four revolutionary papers that transformed physics, including work on the photoelectric effect, for which he later received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. After relocating to Berlin in 1914, Einstein fled Germany in 1933 during Hitler's rise to power and settled in the United States, where he became a citizen in 1940. His famous equation E = mc², perhaps the world's most recognized scientific formula, emerged from his special theory of relativity, and his work had profound implications for both science and philosophy. Despite spending his later years working unsuccessfully on a unified field theory and opposing certain aspects of quantum mechanics, Einstein's genius and originality have made him synonymous with brilliance, leading to his recognition as Time's Person of the Century in 1999.</p>

            <h2>Controversies</h2>
            <p>There were several notable controversies in Einstein's life and work. His relationship with Mileva Maric, his first wife, sparked historical debate about the extent of her contributions to his groundbreaking scientific papers, with some scholars questioning her influence on his work while others suggesting she had meaningful scientific input. There was also controversy surrounding his opposition to quantum mechanics, particularly in his famous debates with Niels Bohr, where Einstein refused to accept the randomness inherent in quantum theory, famously declaring that "God does not play dice." Another controversial aspect was the handling of his brain after death, when pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed and preserved it without the family's permission. Additionally, while Einstein was celebrated in America, his political views, including his socialism and pacifism, drew scrutiny, leading to the FBI creating a secret dossier on him that grew to 1,427 pages. His support for civil rights and criticism of racism in America, while admirable today, was controversial for his time, as was his initial involvement with and later criticism of nuclear weapons development, expressing regret for his letter to President Roosevelt that helped initiate the Manhattan Project.</p>
